Create a modern, minimal cloud architecture diagram for a real-time survey platform called “ThinkFast”.

Use clean, balanced spacing and minimal styling.
Use color-coded layers & Icons for clear distinction, not grayscale

# Overall Layout
- Place an “External Users” group at the top.
- Below it, place a large group labeled “AWS EC2 (Single Host)” that contains all system containers.
- On the left or bottom-left, place “GitHub” and “Jenkins CI/CD” to show the deployment pipeline.
- Draw all Docker containers as individual components inside the EC2 box.

# External Users
Component: “Survey Users (Browser / Mobile)”
- Connect to Frontend (port 80) inside EC2.

# AWS EC2 (Single Host)
Group Name: “AWS EC2 (Single Host) — Docker Engine”

Inside this group, create the following components:

1. Component: “thinkfast-frontend (Vue 3 + Nginx)”
   - Label: “Port 80”
   - This serves the survey UI.

2. Component: “thinkfast-backend (Spring Boot API)”
   - Label: “Port 8080”
   - Provides REST APIs and WebSocket endpoints.

3. Component: “redis:7 (Cache + Pub/Sub)”
   - Label: “Port 6379”
   - Used for real-time WebSocket broadcasting, participant counts, pub/sub events.

4. Component: “mariadb:11 (Database)”
   - Label: “Port 3306”
   - Stores surveys, questions, answers, responses, statistics.

5. Component: “jenkins (CI/CD Server)”
   - Label: “Port 9090 → 8080, 50000”
   - Builds Docker images and redeploys containers.

# Connections inside EC2
- Arrow: frontend → backend (HTTP + WebSocket)
- Arrow: backend ↔ redis (real-time pub/sub)
- Arrow: backend ↔ mariadb (database queries)

# External CI/CD Flow
Create the following components outside the EC2 box:

1. Component: “GitHub Repository”
   - Connect: GitHub → Jenkins (webhook or polling)

2. Jenkins → Docker Engine inside EC2
   - Arrow label: “Build, Push, Restart Containers”

# Data Flow Summary
Use arrows to show:
- User → Frontend (port 80)
- Frontend → Backend (REST/WebSocket 8080)
- Backend ↔ Redis (6379)
- Backend ↔ MariaDB (3306)
- Jenkins → EC2 Docker Engine (CI/CD Deploy)
- GitHub → Jenkins (source updates)

Generate the diagram with minimal, modern node boxes and clean layout.
